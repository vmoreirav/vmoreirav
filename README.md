- 👋 Hi, I’m @vmoreirav
- 👀 I became a developer, since the last time that I wrote this. I learned in this time that:

     “Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.” - Robert Collier 

- I keep thinking that I can put together my knowledge from International Relations and world of developer (maybe this bridge can be made by the world of data science).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. This stacks are the main, but I have study Redux, Git, Typescript and others.
- Right now I'm looking for understand how I can become a good developer whith a good job. By the way, if you want connect with follow the link:
